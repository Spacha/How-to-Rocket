				<h2>Notice</h2>
				
				<p>ROCKETLAB cannot assume responsibility, in any manner whatsoever, for the use
				readers make of the information presented herein or the devices resulting
				therefrom.</p>

				<h2>Foreword</h2>
				
				<p>The rocket engine is a relatively simple device in which propellants are burned
				and the resulting high pressure gases are expanded through a specially shaped nozzle
				to produce thrust. Gas pressurized propellant tanks and simple propellant flow
				controls make operation of a small liquid-fuel rocket engine about as simple as
				operating an automobile engine. Why then do so many amateur rocket engines fail or
				cause injury? The reason, usually and simply, is that the amateur is not accustomed
				to high pressure devices operating near material temperature limits. His normal
				everyday life is, instead, filled with devices and gadgets operating at low
				pressures and at low thermal energy levels. With proper design, careful workmanship,
				and good test equipment, operated in a safe manner, the amateur can build small,
				liquid-fuel rocket engines which will have hours of safe operating life.</p>

				<p>The purpose of this publication is to provide the serious amateur builder with
				design information, fabrication procedures, test equipment requirements, and safe
				operating procedures for small liquid-fuel rocket engines.</p>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<p>A liquid rocket engine employs liquid propellants which are fed under pressure
				from tanks in to a combustion chamber. The propellants usually consist of a liquid
				oxidizer and a liquid fuel. In the combustion chamber the propellants chemically
				react (burn) to form hot gases which are then accelerated and ejected at high
				velocity through a nozzle, thereby imparting momentum to the engine. Momentum is the
				product of mass and velocity. The thrust force of a rocket motor is the reaction
				experienced by the motor structure due to the ejection of the high velocity matter.
				This is the same phenomenon which pushes a garden hose backward as water squirts
				from the nozzle or makes a gun recoil when fired.</p>

				<div id="figure-1" class="fig">
					<div class="img"><div class="img"><img src="img/fig-1.png" alt="figure-1" /></div></div>
					<span class="caption"><span class="fig-text">Figure 1</span> Typical Rocket Motor</span>
				</div>

				<p>A typical rocket motor consists of the combustion chamber, the nozzle, and the
				injector, as shown in <a class="figure-link" href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>. The
				combustion chamber is where the burning of propellants takes place at high pressure.
				The chamber must be strong enough to contain the high pressure generated by, and the
				high temperature resulting from, the combustion process. Because of the high
				temperature and heat transfer, the chamber and nozzle are usually cooled. The
				chamber must also be of sufficient length to ensure complete combustion before the
				gases enter the nozzle.</p>

				<div id="figure-2" class="fig">
					<div class="img"><img src="img/fig-2.png" alt="figure-2" /></div>
					<span class="caption"><span class="fig-text">Figure 2</span> DeLaval Nozzle</span>
				</div>

				<p>The function of the nozzle is to convert the chemical-thermal energy generated
				in the combustion chamber into kinetic energy, The nozzle converts the slow moving,
				high pressure, high temperature gas in the combustion chamber into high velocity gas
				of lower pressure and temperature. Since thrust is the product of mass (the amount
				of gas flowing through the nozzle) and velocity, a very high gas velocity is
				desirable. Gas velocities from one to two miles per second (5000 to 12000 feet per
				second) can be obtained in rocket nozzles. Nozzles which perform this seemingly
				amazing feat are called DeLaval nozzles (after their inventor) and consist of a
				convergent and divergent section, as shown in
				<a class="figure-link" href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>. The minimum flow area
				between the convergent and divergent section is called the nozzle throat. The flow
				area at the end of the divergent section is called the nozzle exit area. The nozzle
				is usually made long enough (or the exit area is great enough) such that the
				pressure in the combustion chamber is reduced at the nozzle exit to the pressure
				existing outside the nozzle. If the rocket engine is being fired at sea level this
				pressure is about 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). If the engine is designed for
				operation at high altitude, the exit pressure is less than 14.7 psi. The drop in
				temperature of the combustion gases flowing through the nozzle is high and can be as
				much as 2000-3000 ℉. Since the gases in the combustion chamber may be at
				5000-6000 ℉, the gas temperature at the nozzle exit is still about 3000 ℉.</p>

				<h2 id="propellant-choice">Propellant choice</h2>

				<p>Liquid rocket engines can burn a variety of oxidizer - fuel combinations, some of
				which are tabulated in <a class="table-link" href="#table-1">Table I</a>. Most of
				the propellant combinations listed are dangerous, toxic, and expensive. The amateur
				builder of rocket engines on the other hand, requires propellants that are readily
				available, reasonably safe and easy to handle, and inexpensive. Based on experience,
				ROCKETLAB recommends the use of gaseous oxygen as the oxidizer and a hydrocarbon
				liquid as the fuel. They give good performance, the combustion flame is readily
				visible, and their high combustion temperature presents an adequate design challenge
				to the amateur builder. The propellants are used in the Atlas missile and the Saturn
				space booster. In these systems, however, liquid rather than gaseous oxygen is used
				as the oxidizer.</p>

				<p>Gaseous oxygen can be readily and inexpensively obtained in pressurized cylinders
				in almost any community because of its use in oxy-acetylene welding. With reasonable
				precautions, to be detailed later, the gas (and cylinder) is safe to handle for
				rocket test stand use. Gas pressures are easily regulated with commercial regulators
				and gas flow rate is easily controlled with commercially available valves.</p>

				<p>Hydrocarbon fuels, such as gasoline and alcohol, are readily available in any
				community. Safety precautions are already known by most responsible individuals due
				to wide use of the fuels in internal combustion engines for automobiles and power
				equipment.</p>

				<p>All subsequent sections of this publication will refer to, and assume, that the
				propellants to be used in amateur liquid-fuel rocket engines are gaseous oxygen and
				hydrocarbon fuel.</p>

				<p>The flame temperature of hydrocarbon fuels burned in gaseous oxygen at various
				combustion chamber pressures is shown in <a class="figure-link" href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>
				for the stoichiometric mixture ratio. Mixture ratio is defined as the weight flow of
				oxidizer divided by the weight flow of fuel, or</p>

				<!-- O/F = W<sub>o</sub>/W<sub>f</sub>		(1)<br /> -->
				<div id="formula-1" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-1.png" alt="formula-1"></div>

				<p class="formula-explanation">
					where<br />
					w<sub>o</sub> = lb of oxygen/sec<br />
					w<sub>f</sub> = lb of fuel/sec<br />
				</p>

				<p>When a stoichiometric ratio is achieved just enough oxygen is present to
				chemically react with all the fuel; the highest flame temperature is achieved under
				these conditions. If a lower flame temperature is desired it is usually better to
				have more fuel present than oxidizer; this is known as burning "off-ratio" or
				"fuel-rich." This condition is less severe on the rocket engine than burning, at
				stoichiometric or oxygen-rich conditions.</p>

				<p><a class="figure-link" href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a> indicates how the flame
				temperature varies when combustion chamber pressure is held at a constant value and
				the mixture ratio is allowed to vary.</p>

				specific impulse and is defined as</p>

				<p><a class="figure-link" href="#figure-5">Figure 5</a>
				indicates the maximum performance possible from hydrocarbon fuels burned
				with gaseous oxygen at various chamber pressures with the gas expanded to
				atmospheric pressure. This graph can be used to determine the propellant flow rate
				required to produce a certain thrust. Suppose you wish to design a rocket engine
				using gaseous oxygen/gasoline propellants to be burned at a chamber pressure of 200
				psi with a thrust of 100 lbs. At these conditions the propellant performance, from
				<a class="figure-link" href="#figure-5">Figure 5</a>, is 244 lb of thrust per lb of
				propellant burned per second. Therefore</p>

				<p>The nozzle throat cross-sectional area may be computed if the total propellant
				flow rate is known and the propellants and operating conditions have been chosen.
				Assuming perfect gas law theory:</p>

				<!-- At = Wt/Pt SQRT(R Tt/(gamma)g_c)	(7) -->
				<div id="formula-7" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-7.png" alt="formula-7"></div>


				<p class="formula-explanation">
					where R = gas constant, given by R = R_bar/M. R_bar is the universal gas
					constant equal to 1545.32 ft-lb/lb°R, and M is the molecular weight of the gas.
					The molecular weight of the hot gaseous products of combustion of gaseous
					oxygen/hydrocarbon fuel is about 24, so that R is about 65 ft-lb/lb°R.
				</p>

				<p>Gamma, (ɣ), is the ratio of gas specific heats and is a thermodynamic variable
				which the reader is encouraged to read about elsewhere
				(see <a href="#bibliography">Bibliography</a>). Gamma is about 1.2 for the products
				of combustion of gaseous oxygen/hydrocarbon fuel.</p>

				<p>g<sub>c</sub> is a constant relating to the earth's gravitation and is equal to
				32.2 ft/sec/sec.</p>

				<p>For further calculations the reader may consider the following as constants
				whenever gaseous oxygen/hydrocarbon propellants are used:</p>
				
				<p>
					R = 65 ft-lb/lb°R<br /> 
					ɣ = 1.2<br />
					g<sub>c</sub> = 32.2 ft/sec<sup>2</sup>
				</p>

				<p>T<sub>t</sub> is the temperature of the gases at the nozzle throat. The gas
				temperature at the nozzle throat is less than in the combustion chamber due to loss
				of thermal energy in accelerating the gas to the local speed of sound
				(Mach number = 1) at the throat. Therefore</p>

				<!-- Tt = Tc (1/(1+((gamma)-1)/2))	(8) -->
				<div id="formula-8" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-8.png" alt="formula-8"></div>

				<div id="formula-10" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-10.png" alt="formula-10"></div>

				<p>P<sub>t</sub> is the gas pressure at the nozzle throat. The pressure at the

				<p>The hot gases must now be expanded in the diverging section of the nozzle to

				<p>Mach number is the ratio of the gas velocity to the local speed of sound. The

				<p>The chamber diameter for small combustion chambers (thrust level less than 75lbs)

				<h2 id="chamber-wall-thickness">Chamber Wall Thickness</h2>

				<p>The combustion chamber must be able to withstand the internal pressure of the hot
				combustion gases. The combustion chamber must also be physically attached to the
				cooling jacket and, therefore, the chamber wall thickness must be sufficient for
				welding or brazing purposes. Since the chamber will be a cylindrical shell, the
				working stress in the wall is given by</p>

				<!-- S = PD/2t_w		(22) -->
				<div id="formula-23" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-23.png" alt="formula-23"></div>


				<p>where P is the pressure in the combustion chamber (neglecting the effect of
				coolant pressure on the outside of the shell), D is the mean diameter of the
				cylinder, and t<sub>w</sub> is the thickness of the cylinder wall. A typical
				material for small water-cooled combustion chambers is copper, for which the
				allowable working stress is about 8000 psi. The thickness of the combustion chamber
				wall is therefore given by</p>

				<!-- t_w = PD/16000	   	(23) -->
				<div id="formula-24" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-24.png" alt="formula-24"></div>

				<p>This is the minimum thickness; actually the thickness should be somewhat greater

				chamber wall and nozzle are usually equal.</p>

				<p>Equation (<a class="formula-link" href="#formula-24">24</a>) can also be used to calculate the wall thickness of the water
				cooling jacket. Here again, the value of t<sub>w</sub> will be the minimum thickness
				since welding factors and design considerations (such as O-rings, grooves, etc.)
				will usually require walls thicker than those indicated by the stress equation.
				A new allowable stress value must be used in Equation (<a class="formula-link" href="#formula-24">24</a>), dependent on the jacket
				material chosen.</p>

				<!-- CH 3.4 -->
				<h2 id="engine-cooling">Engine Cooling</h2>

				<p>The amateur should not consider building uncooled rocket engines since they can
				operate for only a short time and their design requires a thorough knowledge of
				heat and mass transfer engineering. Cooled rocket motors have provision for cooling
				some or all metal parts coming into contact with the hot combustion gases. The
				injector is usually self-cooled by the incoming flow of propellants. The combustion
				chamber and nozzle definitely require cooling.</p>

				<p>A cooling jacket permits the circulation of a coolant, which, in the case of
				flight engines is usually one of the propellants. However, for static tests and for
				amateur operation, water is the only coolant recommended. The cooling jacket
				consists of an inner and outer wall. The combustion chamber forms the inner wall and
				another concentric but larger cylinder provides the outer wall. The space between
				the walls serves as the coolant passage. The nozzle throat region usually has the
				highest heat transfer intensity and is, therefore, the most difficult to cool.</p>

				<p>The energy release per unit chamber volume of a rocket engine is very large, and
				can be 250 times that of a good steam boiler or five times that of a gas turbine
				combustion chamber. The heat transfer rate of a rocket engine is usually 20 to 200
				times that of a good boiler. It is apparent, therefore, that the cooling of a rocket
				engine is a difficult and exacting task. The complete heat transfer design of a
				rocket engine is extremely complex and is usually beyond the capabilities of most
				amateur builders. Some important empirical design guidelines are available, however,
				and are listed below:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Use water as the coolant.</li>
					<li>Use copper for the combustion chamber and nozzle walls.</li>
					<li>Water flow velocity in the cooling jacket should be 20-50 ft/sec.</li>
					<li>Water flow rate should be high enough so that boiling does not occur.</li>
					<li>Extend the water cooling jacket beyond the face of the injector.</li>
					<li>A steady flow of cooling water is essential.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<!-- CH 3.5 -->
				<h2 id="hear-transfer">Heat Transfer</h2>

				<p>The largest part of the heat transferred from the hot chamber gases to the
				chamber walls is by convection. The amount of heat transferred by conduction is
				small and the amount transferred by radiation is usually less than 25%, of the
				total. The chamber walls have to be kept at a temperature such that the wall
				material strength is adequate to prevent failure. Material failure is usually caused
				by either raising the wall temperature on the gas side so as to weaken, melt, or
				damage the wall material or by raising the wall temperature on the liquid coolant
				side so as to vaporize the liquid next to the wall. The consequent failure is
				caused because of the sharp temperature rise in the wall caused by excessive heat
				transfer to the boiling coolant.</p>

				<p>In water-cooled chambers the transferred heat is absorbed by the water. The water
				must have an adequate heat capacity to prevent boiling of the water at any point in
				the cooling jacket. The total heat transferred from the chamber to the cooling water
				is given by</p>

				<!-- Q = q A = w_w * c_p * (T - Ti)		(24) -->
				<div id="formula-25" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-25.png" alt="formula-25"></div>

				<!-- CH 3.6 -->
				<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

				<p>The combustion chamber and nozzle walls have to withstand relatively high
				temperature, high gas velocity, chemical erosion, and high stress. The wall material
				must be capable of high heat transfer rates (which means good thermal conductivity)
				yet, at the same time, have adequate strength to withstand the chamber combustion
				pressure. Material requirements are critical only in those parts which come into
				direct contact with propellant gases. Other motor components can be made of
				conventional material.</p>

				<p>Once the wall material of an operating rocket engine begins to fail, final
				burn-through and engine destruction are extremely rapid. Even a small pinhole in the
				chamber wall will almost immediately (within one second) open into a large hole
				because the hot chamber gases (4000-6000 ℉) will oxidize or melt the adjacent metal,
				which is then blown away exposing new metal to the hot gases.</p>

				<p>Exotic metals and difficult fabrication techniques are used in today's space and
				missile rocket engines, providing a lightweight structure absolutely required for
				efficient launch and flight vehicles. These advanced metals and fabrication
				techniques are far outside the reach of the serious amateur builder. However, the
				use of more commonplace (and much less expensive) metals and fabrication techniques
				is quite possible, except that a flightweight engine will not result. Since almost
				all amateur rocket firing should be conducted on a static test stand, this is not a
				severe restriction to the amateur builder. Experience with a wide variety of rocket
				engine designs leads to the following reconmendations for amateur rocket engines:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>The combustion chamber and nozzle should be machined in one piece, from
					copper.</li>
					<li>Those injector parts in contact with the hot chamber gases should also be
					machined from copper.</li>
					<li>The cooling jacket and those injector parts not in contact with the hot
					propellant gases, should be fabricated from brass or stainless steel.</li>
					<li>Expert machine and welding work is essential to produce a safe and useable
					rocket engine. Shoddy or careless workmanship, or poor welds, can easily cause
					engine failure.</li>
				</ol>

				<!-- CH 3.7 -->
				<h2 id="injectors">Injectors</h2>

				<p>The function of the injector is to introduce the propellants into the combustion
				chamber in such a way that efficient combustion can occur. There are two types of
				injectors which the amateur builder can consider for small engine design. One of
				these is the impinging stream injector in which the oxidizer and fuel are injected
				through a number of separate holes so that the resulting streams intersect with each
				other. The fuel stream will impinge with the oxidizer stream and both will break up
				into small droplets. When gaseous oxygen is used as the oxidizer, and a liquid
				hydrocarbon is used as fuel, the impingement of the liquid stream with the high
				velocity gas stream results in diffusion and vaporisation, causing good mixing and
				efficient combustion. A disadvantage of this type of injector is that extremely
				small holes are required for small engine flow rates and the hydraulic
				characteristics and equations normally used to predict injector parameters do not
				give good results for small orifices. The small holes are also difficult to drill,
				especially in soft copper.</p>

				<p>However, to provide a complete picture of the equations used in rocket engine
				design, we present below the equation for the flow of liquid through a simple
				orifice (a round drilled hole, for example)</p>

				<!-- w = Cd A SQRT(2g(rho)(deltaP))		(25) -->
				<div id="formula-26" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-26.png" alt="formula-26"></div>

				<p>
					where<br />
					w = propellant flow rate, lb/sec<br />
					A = area of orifice, ft<sup>2</sup><br />
					ΔP = pressure drop across orifice, psi<br />
					ρ = density of propellant, lb/ft<sup>3</sup><br />
					g = gravitational constant, 32.2 ft/sec<sup>2</sup><br />
					C<sub>d</sub> = orifice discharge coefficient<br />
				</p>

				<p>The discharge coefficient for a well-shaped simple orifice will usually have a
				value between 0.5 and 0.7.</p>

				<p>The injection velocity, or velocity of the liquid stream issuing from the
				orifice, is given by</p>

				<!-- v = Cd SQRT(2g((deltaP)/(rho)))		(26) -->
				<div id="formula-27" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-27.png" alt="formula-27"></div>

				<p>Injection pressure drops of 70 to 150 psi, or injection velocities of 50 to 100
				ft/sec are usually used in small liquid-fuel rocket engines. The injection pressure
				drop must be high enough to eliminate combustion instability inside the combustion
				chamber but must not be so high that the tankage and pressurization system used to
				supply fuel to the engine are penalized.</p>

				<p>A second type of injector is the spray nozzle in which conical, solid cone,
				hollow cone, or other type of spray sheet can be obtained. When a liquid hydrocarbon
				fuel is forced through a spray nozzle (similar to those used in home oil burners)
				the resulting fuel droplets are easily mixed with gaseous oxygen and the resulting
				mixture readily vaporized and burned. Spray nozzles are especially attractive for
				the amateur builder since several companies manufacture them commercially for oil
				burners and other applications. The amateur need only determine the size and spray
				characteristics required for his engine design and the correct spray nozzle can then
				be purchased at low cost. <a class="figure-link" href="#figure-7">Figure 7</a>
				illustrates the two types of injectors.</p>

				<p>The use of commercial spray nozzles for amateur built rocket engines is highly
				recommended.</p>

				<p>The following example illustrates the use of the equations,

				<p>A small water-cooled liquid-fuel rocket engine is to be

				<!-- CH 4.1.1 -->
				<h3 id="example-step-2">Step 1</h3>

				<p>From <a class="table-link" href="#table-1">Table I</a> and Figures
				<a class="figure-link" href="#figure-3">3</a>,
				<a class="figure-link" href="#figure-4">4</a> and
				<a class="figure-link" href="#figure-5">5</a> we determine that the

				<div id="formula-28" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-28.png" alt="formula-28"></div>

				<p>Since the mixture ratio, <i>r</i>, is 2.5, we find from Equation (<a class="formula-link" href="#formula-5">5</a>)</p>

				<!-- w<sub>f</sub> = w<sub>t</sub>/(r + 1) = 0.077/3.5 = 0.022 lb/sec -->

				<p>As a check, we divide the oxygen flow rate by the fuel flow rate and

				<h3 id="example-step-2">Step 2</h3>

				<p>From <a class="table-link" href="#table-1">Table I</a> we note that the chamber

				<p>A<sub>e</sub>/A<sub>t</sub> = 3.65 so that the nozzle exit area is, from

				<h3 id="example-step-8">Step 8</h3>

				<p>For this propellant combination we will assume a combustion chamber L* of 60

				<!-- <p>V<sub>c</sub> = L* A<sub>t</sub> = (60)(.0444) = 2.67 in<sup>3</sup></p> -->

				<div id="formula-39" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-39.png" alt="formula-39"></div>

				<p>However, we must first determine the chamber area or A<sub>c</sub>. We do this by

				D<sub>c</sub> = 5D<sub>t</sub>, therefore</p>

				<p>D<sub>c</sub> = 1.2 in. and A<sub>c</sub> = 1.13 in<sup>2</sup></p>

				<p>Therefore,</p>

				<div id="formula-40" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-40.png" alt="formula-40"></div>

				<h3 id="example-step-10">Step 10</h3>

				<p>Copper will be used for the combustion chamber and nozzle

				<p>t<sub>w</sub> = PD/16000 = (300)(1.2)/16000</p>

				<p>t<sub>w</sub> = 0.0225 inch</p>

				<p>To allow for additional stress and welding factors we shall set the
				wall thickness equal to 3/32 or 0.09375 inch and will assume that the
				nozzle wall has this thickness also.</p>

				<h3 id="example-step-11">Step 11</h3>

				<p>Previous experience with small watercooled rocket engines
				has shown that we can expect the copper combustion chamber and
				nozzle to experience an average heat transfer rate, q, of ahout 3
				Btu/in<sup>2</sup>-sec. The heat transfer area of the combustion chamber is the
				outer surface area of the chamber and nozzle. This surface area is
				given by</p>

				<p>A = (D<sub>c</sub> + 2t<sub>w</sub>)(L<sub>c</sub>) + area of nozzle cone</p>

				<p>A = 9.4 in<sup>2</sup> + area of nozzle cone</p>

				<p>The area of the nozzle cone up to the throat can be assumed to be
				about 10% of the chamber surface area so that</p>

				<p>A = (1.1)(9.4) = 10.35 in<sup>2</sup></p>

				<p>The total heat transferred into the coolant is given by Eq. (<a class="formula-link" href="#formula-24">24</a>)</p>

				<p>Q = q A = 3(10.35) = 31 Btu/sec</p>

				<h3 id="example-step-12">Step 12</h3>

				<p>The cooling water flow rate can be calculated by assuming
				a desired temperature rise of the water. If this is 40 ℉ then,
				from Eq. (<a class="formula-link" href="#formula-24">24</a>)</p>

				<p>w<sub>v</sub> = Q/(deltaT), where c<sub>p</sub> for water = 1.0</p>

				<p>w = 31/40 = 0.775 lb of water per sec.</p>

				<h3 id="example-step-13">Step 13</h3>

				<p>The annular flow passage between the combustion chamber wall
				and the outer jacket must be sized so that the flow velocity of the
				cooling water is at least 30 ft/sec. This velocity is obtained when
				the flow passage has dimensions as determined below:</p>

				<p>v<sub>w</sub> = w<sub>w</sub>/(rho)A</p>

				<p>where v<sub>w</sub> = 30 ft/sec, w<sub>w</sub> = 0.775 lb/sec,
				(rho) = 62.4 lb/ft3, and A is the area of the annular flow passage,
				given by</p>

				<p>A = (π/4) (D<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> - D1<sup>2</sup>)</p>

				<p>where D<sup>2</sup> is the inner diameter of the outer jacket and D<sub>1</sub> is the
				outer diameter of the combustion chamber, given by</p>

				<p>D<sub>1</sub> = D<sub>c</sub> + 2t<sub>w</sub></p>

				<p>Substituting in the above equations</p>

				<p>D<sub>2</sub> = SQRT((4w<sub>w</sub>)/(v<sub>w</sub>ρπ) + D<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)</p>
				
				<p>D<sub>2</sub> = (.0151)<sup>1/2</sup> = .123 ft = 1.475 inch</p>

				<p>D<sub>2</sub> - D<sub>1</sub> = 0.085 inch</p>

				<p>The water flow gap is 0.0425 inch.</p>

				<h3 id="example-step-14">Step 14</h3>

				<p>The fuel injector for this small rocket engine will be a
				commercial spray nozzle with a 75 degree spray angle. The required
				capacity of the nozzle is determined by the fuel flow rate</p>

				<p>w<sub>f</sub> = 0.022 lb/sec = 1.32 lb/ minute,</p>

				<p>Since there are six pounds of gasoline per gallon, the spray nozzle
				flow requirement is 0.22 gallon per minute (gpm). The spray nozzle
				can now be ordered from any of several suppliers (see List of
				Suppliers); nozzle material should be brass to ensure adequate
				injector heat transfer to the incoming propellant.</p>

				<p>If an impinging jet injector had been chosen, the
				determination of the required injector hole number and size would
				have been as follows:</p>

				<p>The flow area for fuel injection is given by Equation (<a class="formula-link" href="#formula-26">26</a>)</p>

				<p>A = w<sub>f</sub>/(C<sub>d</sub>) (2gρΔP)<sup>1/2</sup></p>

				<p>We will assume that C<sub>d</sub> = 0.7 with a fuel injection pressure drop
				of 100 psi. The density of gasoline is about 44.5 lb/ft<sup>3</sup>, so that</p>

				<p>A = .022/(.7)(6430) = 0.0000049 ft<sup>2</sup></p>

				<p>A = 0.000706 in<sup>2</sup></p>

				<p>If only one injection hole is used (a poor practice which can
				lead to combustion instability) its diameter would be</p>

				<p>D = (4Aπ)<sup>1/2</sup> = .0009<sup>1/2</sup> = 0.30 inch</p>

				<p>A number 69 drill could be used for this hole.</p>

				<p>If two injection holes are used, their diameter would be</p>

				<p>D = .00045<sup>1/2</sup> = 0.021 inch</p>

				<p>A number 75 drill could be used for these holes.</p>

				<h3 id="example-step-15">Step 15</h3>

				<p>The injection holes for the gaseous oxygen will be simple
				drilled orifices. The size of these orifices should be such that a
				gas stream velocity or about 200 ft/sec is obtained at design
				oxygen flow rate. The holes must not be so small that sonic velocity
				is achieved in the orifice passages since this would result in a high
				upstream pressure requirement to drive the required amount of oxygen
				through the orifices.</p>

				<p>If a spray nozzle fuel injector is used we will assume the use
				of four equally spaced oxygen injection ports parallel to the
				combustion chamber centerline around this nozzle. If we assume an
				injection pressure drop of 100 psi then the oxygen gas pressure at the
				entrance to the injection ports will be 400 psi (the chamber pressure
				plus the injection pressure drop). The density of gaseous oxygen at
				400 psi and a temperature of 68 ℉ is given by the perfect gas law
				(see <a class="table-link" href="#table-2">Table II</a>).</p>

				<p>ρ<sub>2</sub> = ρ<sub>1</sub>(P<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>1</sub>) = 2.26 lb/ft<sup>3</sup></p>

				<p>Assuming, incompressibility, the injection flow area is given by</p>

				<p>A = w<sub>o</sub>/ρv<sub>o</sub></p>

				<p>Since we know the oxygen flow rate and the desired injection
				velocity, we can easily find the total injection area</p>

				<p>A = .055/(2.26)(200) = 0.0001217 ft<sup>2</sup></p>

				<p>A = 0.0175 in<sup>2</sup></p>

				<p>Since there are to be four holes, each hole has an area of 0.004375
				in<sup>2</sup> and the diameter of each hole is</p>

				<p>D = (.00558)<sup>1/2</sup> = 0.0747 inch</p>

				<p>A number 48 drill could be used for these holes.</p>

				<p>These same size oxygen jets could also be used with two fuel
				jets in the impinging stream injector. The holes, oxygen and fuel,
				should be drilled at an angle of 45° with respect to the injector
				face with the intersection point of the streams about 1/4 inch inside
				the combustion chamber.</p>

				homogeneous materials and careful fabrication technique are definitely required to
				produce a safe, working rocket engine.</p>

				<p>A properly designed small liquid-fuel rocket engine requires the following
				machine and hand tools:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>6" or 10" metal-turning lathe, with attachments</li>
					<li>Precision drill press</li>
					<li>hand files, calipers, micrometers, etc.</li>
					<li>oxy-acetylene torch or small arc welder.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Since a properly designed engine will have symmetrical parts, a milling machine
				or planer will not be required. The metal-turning lathe should have a repeatable
				accuracy of 0.001 inch. The drill press will be used to drill small diameter holes
				and should have a true running, high speed chuck.</p>

				<p>Mensuration equipment such as calipers, micrometers, etc., must be capable of
				inside and outside diameter measurements, lengths, and should be used to locate
				holes, recesses, and other features prior to actual machining.</p>

				<p>The joining of the various engine components is especially critical since the
				engine will operate at high pressure and high temperature.</p>

				<p>The ability of the welder, and the welding techniques employed, should be as good
				as those required for aircraft work. Metal joints must be clean, with a close fit
				between parts to ensure adequate weld strength and integrity. To the extent possible
				assembled components should be tested with water (or nitrogen gas, but that is
				dangerous) prior to actual use with propellants. Repair of leaks or initially poor
				welds must be carefully done with subsequent re-testing with pressurized water
				(called hydro-testing or hydrostatic testing).</p>

				<p>As discussed previously, the combustion chamber should built as a one-piece unit.
				This arrangement, while more difficult from a machining point of view, eliminates
				the requirement for a joint of some kind between the two parts; this joint would be
				exposed to the hot combustion gases (5700 ℉) on one side and would, in all
				probability, fail. Building the combustion chamber and nozzle in one piece
				eliminates this potential failure point. Care must be exercised during the machining
				of the copper chamber/nozzle to ensure constant wall thickness and the correct taper
				in the nozzle region. Thin wall sections are potential failure points and could
				result in almost immediate catastrophic failure during firing.</p>

				<p>Machining of the outer shell or jacket is less critical than the combustion
				chamber/nozzle. Typical materials for this part are stainless steel or brass. The
				inside diameter of the shell should have a smooth finish to reduce cooling pressure
				drop, nnd the outside finish of the shell, which will be visible to the world,
				should reflect the care and concern of the machinist. The shell will also contain
				the coolant entry and exit ports. Since the coolant (typically water) will probably
				have an entry pressure of 60 to 100 psi, these ports and fittings should be
				constructed with some care. The use of flare type fittings with metal tapered seats
				(such as those manufactured by Parker or Weatherland) is highly recomended. The
				shell will also feature a method of attaching the injector and for mounting the
				engine to a test or thrust stand. As shown in
				<a class="figure-link" href="#figure-8">Figure 8</a>, these two mounting
				requirements can be easily combined to simplify the design. The forces to be
				considered when designing the shell are not the thrust forces (which are small,
				typically on the order of 20-30 lbs) but, rather the pressure forces attempting to
				separate the injector from the shell. The pressure acting on the injector area out
				to the point of sealing between the injector and the outer shell is the combustion
				chamber pressure, which is typically 100 to 300 psi. The force attempting to
				separate the injector from the shell is slightly over 600 lbs for the design shown
				in <a class="figure-link" href="#figure-8">Figure 8</a> at a combustion pressure of
				300 psi. The bolts holding the two components together (and in this case also
				holding the assembly to the test mount) must withstand this force with and adequate
				safety factor (typically a factor of two). The number and size of bolts required can
				be obtained from <a class="table-link" href="#table-4">Table IV</a>, which gives the
				average load capacity of high strength steel bolts of various sizes. The strength of
				these bolts, however, depends to some extent on the adequacy of the threads in
				tapped holes, the tapped material, and the bolt tightening procedure used in
				assembly.</p>

				<p>The outer shell must also contain a sealing device to prevent the high pressure
				combustion chamber gas from flowing back past the injector. With an appropriately
				configured water-cooled design, the use of an elastomeric O-ring is highly
				desirable. A standard neoprene O-ring (manufactured by a number of companies, see
				List of Suppliers) will give reliable service if the surrounding metal does not
				exceed a temperature of 200-300 ℉ . Dimensions and design parameters for O-rings
				and O-ring grooves are given in manufacturers supply catalogs.</p>

				<p>Another method of sealing is the use of an asbestos-copper crush gasket (very
				similar to those used on automobile spark plugs, only larger; see
				<a href="#list-of-suppliers">List of Suppliers</a>). The copper crush gasket is
				positioned by a V-groove cut in the surface of the outer jacket at the sealing
				point. The mating surface of the injector should be smooth and flat with no machine
				marks.</p>

				<p>Figure <a class="figure-link" href="#figure-9">9</a> illustrates the relationship between an O-ring and a copper crush gasket
				and their mating surfaces.</p>

					gasket.</span>
				</div>

				<p>The injector should be fabricated from copper to provide maximum heat transfer
				from the injector face to the incoming propellants. The outer shell of the injector
				can be made from either copper, stainless steel, or brass. However, since the
				propellant inlet fittings (again these should be the tapered seat, metal-to-metal
				kind) should be stainless steel for best results. It is usually a good idea to make
				the injector outer shell from stainless steel so that the inlet fittings can be arc
				welded. Then the outer shell can be attached to the remainder of the injector by
				silver brazing without weakening the inlet fitting welds.</p>

				<p>Injection holes for the gaseous oxygen (and for the fuel, if impinging jets are
				used) will usually be made with numbered drills of small diameter. Extreme care
				should be used in drilling these holes, especially in soft copper. The drilled hole
				should have an entry and exit free from burrs or chips. It is vitally important that
				injector components be thoroughly cleaned and deburred prior to assembly. After
				injector welding, hot water should be used to thoroughly clean the injector assembly
				of brazing flux and residues, and the assembly should receive a final rinse in
				acetone or alcohol.</p>
