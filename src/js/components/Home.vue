			<h2>Notice</h2>
			
			<p>ROCKETLAB cannot assume responsibility, in any manner whatsoever, for the use
			readers make of the information presented herein or the devices resulting
			therefrom.</p>

			<h2>Foreword</h2>
			
			<p>The rocket engine is a relatively simple device in which propellants are burned
			and the resulting high pressure gases are expanded through a specially shaped nozzle
			to produce thrust. Gas pressurized propellant tanks and simple propellant flow
			controls make operation of a small liquid-fuel rocket engine about as simple as
			operating an automobile engine. Why then do so many amateur rocket engines fail or
			cause injury? The reason, usually and simply, is that the amateur is not accustomed
			to high pressure devices operating near material temperature limits. His normal
			everyday life is, instead, filled with devices and gadgets operating at low
			pressures and at low thermal energy levels. With proper design, careful workmanship,
			and good test equipment, operated in a safe manner, the amateur can build small,
			liquid-fuel rocket engines which will have hours of safe operating life.</p>

			<p>The purpose of this publication is to provide the serious amateur builder with
			design information, fabrication procedures, test equipment requirements, and safe
			operating procedures for small liquid-fuel rocket engines.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>A liquid rocket engine employs liquid propellants which are fed under pressure
			from tanks in to a combustion chamber. The propellants usually consist of a liquid
			oxidizer and a liquid fuel. In the combustion chamber the propellants chemically
			react (burn) to form hot gases which are then accelerated and ejected at high
			velocity through a nozzle, thereby imparting momentum to the engine. Momentum is the
			product of mass and velocity. The thrust force of a rocket motor is the reaction
			experienced by the motor structure due to the ejection of the high velocity matter.
			This is the same phenomenon which pushes a garden hose backward as water squirts
			from the nozzle or makes a gun recoil when fired.</p>

			<Figure name="Figure 1" src="img/fig-1.svg" caption="Typical Rocket Motor" />

			<!--<div id="figure-1" class="fig">

			</div>-->

			<p>A typical rocket motor consists of the combustion chamber, the nozzle, and the
			injector, as shown in <a class="figure-link" href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>. The
			combustion chamber is where the burning of propellants takes place at high pressure.
			The chamber must be strong enough to contain the high pressure generated by, and the
			high temperature resulting from, the combustion process. Because of the high
			temperature and heat transfer, the chamber and nozzle are usually cooled. The
			chamber must also be of sufficient length to ensure complete combustion before the
			gases enter the nozzle.</p>

			<Figure name="Figure 2" src="img/fig-2.svg" caption="DeLaval Nozzle" />

			<p>The function of the nozzle is to convert the chemical-thermal energy generated
			in the combustion chamber into kinetic energy, The nozzle converts the slow moving,
			high pressure, high temperature gas in the combustion chamber into high velocity gas
			of lower pressure and temperature. Since thrust is the product of mass (the amount
			of gas flowing through the nozzle) and velocity, a very high gas velocity is
			desirable. Gas velocities from <span v-if="unitSystem=='US'">one to two miles per second (5000 to 12000 feet per
			second)</span><span v-else>1.5 to 3.7 kilometers per second</span> can be obtained in rocket nozzles. Nozzles which perform this seemingly
			amazing feat are called DeLaval nozzles (after their inventor) and consist of a
			convergent and divergent section, as shown in
			<a class="figure-link" href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>. The minimum flow area
			between the convergent and divergent section is called the nozzle throat. The flow
			area at the end of the divergent section is called the nozzle exit area. The nozzle
			is usually made long enough (or the exit area is great enough) such that the
			pressure in the combustion chamber is reduced at the nozzle exit to the pressure
			existing outside the nozzle. If the rocket engine is being fired at sea level this
			pressure is about

			<span v-if="unitSystem=='US'">14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). If the engine is designed for
			operation at high altitude, the exit pressure is less than 14.7 psi. The drop in
			temperature of the combustion gases flowing through the nozzle is high and can be as
			much as 2000-3000 °F. Since the gases in the combustion chamber may be at
			5000-6000 °F, the gas temperature at the nozzle exit is still about 3000 °F.
			</span>
			<span v-else>
			101.3 kilopascals (kPa). If the engine is designed for
			operation at high altitude, the exit pressure is less than 101.3 kPa. The drop in
			temperature of the combustion gases flowing through the nozzle is high and can be as
			much as 1100-1600 °C. Since the gases in the combustion chamber may be at
			2700-3200 °C, the gas temperature at the nozzle exit is still about 1600 °C.

			<h2 id="propellant-choice">Propellant Choice</h2>

			<p>Liquid rocket engines can burn a variety of oxidizer - fuel combinations, some of
			which are tabulated in <a class="table-link" href="#table-1">Table I</a>. Most of
			the propellant combinations listed are dangerous, toxic, and expensive. The amateur
			builder of rocket engines on the other hand, requires propellants that are readily
			available, reasonably safe and easy to handle, and inexpensive. Based on experience,
			ROCKETLAB recommends the use of gaseous oxygen as the oxidizer and a hydrocarbon
			liquid as the fuel. They give good performance, the combustion flame is readily
			visible, and their high combustion temperature presents an adequate design challenge
			to the amateur builder. The propellants are used in the Atlas missile and the Saturn
			space booster [see <a href="#additions-and-corrections">Additions and Corrections</a>].
			In these systems, however, liquid rather than gaseous oxygen is used
			as the oxidizer.</p>

			<p>Gaseous oxygen can be readily and inexpensively obtained in pressurized cylinders
			in almost any community because of its use in oxy-acetylene welding. With reasonable
			precautions, to be detailed later, the gas (and cylinder) is safe to handle for
			rocket test stand use. Gas pressures are easily regulated with commercial regulators
			and gas flow rate is easily controlled with commercially available valves.</p>

			<p>Hydrocarbon fuels, such as gasoline and alcohol, are readily available in any
			community. Safety precautions are already known by most responsible individuals due
			to wide use of the fuels in internal combustion engines for automobiles and power
			equipment.</p>

			<p>All subsequent sections of this publication will refer to, and assume, that the
			propellants to be used in amateur liquid-fuel rocket engines are gaseous oxygen and
			hydrocarbon fuel.</p>

			<p>The flame temperature of hydrocarbon fuels burned in gaseous oxygen at various
			combustion chamber pressures is shown in <a class="figure-link" href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>
			for the stoichiometric mixture ratio. Mixture ratio is defined as the weight flow of
			oxidizer divided by the weight flow of fuel, or</p>

			<p>When a stoichiometric ratio is achieved just enough oxygen is present to
			chemically react with all the fuel; the highest flame temperature is achieved under
			these conditions. If a lower flame temperature is desired it is usually better to
			have more fuel present than oxidizer; this is known as burning "off-ratio" or
			"fuel-rich." This condition is less severe on the rocket engine than burning, at
			stoichiometric or oxygen-rich conditions.</p>

			<p><a class="figure-link" href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a> indicates how the flame
			temperature varies when combustion chamber pressure is held at a constant value and

			<h2 id="chamber-wall-thickness">Chamber Wall Thickness</h2>

			<p>The combustion chamber must be able to withstand the internal pressure of the hot

			welding or brazing purposes. Since the chamber will be a cylindrical shell, the

			<!-- S = PD/2t_w		(22) -->
			<div id="formula-23" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-23.png" alt="formula-23"></div>


			<p>where P is the pressure in the combustion chamber (neglecting the effect of
			coolant pressure on the outside of the shell), D is the mean diameter of the
			cylinder, and t<sub>w</sub> is the thickness of the cylinder wall. A typical
			material for small water-cooled combustion chambers is copper, for which the
			allowable working stress is about 8000 psi. The thickness of the combustion chamber
			wall is therefore given by</p>

			<!-- t_w = PD/16000	   	(23) -->
			<div id="formula-24" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-24.png" alt="formula-24"></div>

			<p>This is the minimum thickness; actually the thickness should be somewhat greater

			<p>Equation (<a class="formula-link" href="#formula-24">24</a>) can also be used to calculate the wall thickness of the water
			cooling jacket. Here again, the value of t<sub>w</sub> will be the minimum thickness
			since welding factors and design considerations (such as O-rings, grooves, etc.)
			will usually require walls thicker than those indicated by the stress equation.
			A new allowable stress value must be used in Equation (<a class="formula-link" href="#formula-24">24</a>), dependent on the jacket

			<!-- CH 3.4 -->
			<h2 id="engine-cooling">Engine Cooling</h2>

			<p>The amateur should not consider building uncooled rocket engines since they can
			operate for only a short time and their design requires a thorough knowledge of
			heat and mass transfer engineering. Cooled rocket motors have provision for cooling
			some or all metal parts coming into contact with the hot combustion gases. The
			injector is usually self-cooled by the incoming flow of propellants. The combustion
			chamber and nozzle definitely require cooling.</p>

			<p>A cooling jacket permits the circulation of a coolant, which, in the case of
			flight engines is usually one of the propellants. However, for static tests and for
			amateur operation, water is the only coolant recommended. The cooling jacket
			consists of an inner and outer wall. The combustion chamber forms the inner wall and
			another concentric but larger cylinder provides the outer wall. The space between
			the walls serves as the coolant passage. The nozzle throat region usually has the
			highest heat transfer intensity and is, therefore, the most difficult to cool.</p>

			<p>The energy release per unit chamber volume of a rocket engine is very large, and
			can be 250 times that of a good steam boiler or five times that of a gas turbine
			combustion chamber. The heat transfer rate of a rocket engine is usually 20 to 200
			times that of a good boiler. It is apparent, therefore, that the cooling of a rocket
			engine is a difficult and exacting task. The complete heat transfer design of a
			rocket engine is extremely complex and is usually beyond the capabilities of most
			amateur builders. Some important empirical design guidelines are available, however,
			and are listed below:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Use water as the coolant.</li>
				<li>Use copper for the combustion chamber and nozzle walls.</li>
				<li>Water flow velocity in the cooling jacket should be 20-50 ft/sec.</li>
				<li>Water flow rate should be high enough so that boiling does not occur.</li>
				<li>Extend the water cooling jacket beyond the face of the injector.</li>
				<li>A steady flow of cooling water is essential.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<!-- CH 3.5 -->
			<h2 id="heat-transfer">Heat Transfer</h2>

			<p>The largest part of the heat transferred from the hot chamber gases to the
			chamber walls is by convection. The amount of heat transferred by conduction is
			small and the amount transferred by radiation is usually less than 25%, of the
			total. The chamber walls have to be kept at a temperature such that the wall
			material strength is adequate to prevent failure. Material failure is usually caused
			by either raising the wall temperature on the gas side so as to weaken, melt, or
			damage the wall material or by raising the wall temperature on the liquid coolant
			side so as to vaporize the liquid next to the wall. The consequent failure is
			caused because of the sharp temperature rise in the wall caused by excessive heat
			transfer to the boiling coolant
			[see <a href="#additions-and-corrections">Additions and Corrections</a>].</p>

			<p>In water-cooled chambers the transferred heat is absorbed by the water. The water
			must have an adequate heat capacity to prevent boiling of the water at any point in
			the cooling jacket. The total heat transferred from the chamber to the cooling water
			is given by</p>

			<!-- Q = q A = w_w * c_p * (T - Ti)		(24) -->
			<div id="formula-25" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-25.png" alt="formula-25"></div>

			<!-- CH 3.6 -->
			<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

			<p>The combustion chamber and nozzle walls have to withstand relatively high
			temperature, high gas velocity, chemical erosion, and high stress. The wall material
			must be capable of high heat transfer rates (which means good thermal conductivity)
			yet, at the same time, have adequate strength to withstand the chamber combustion
			pressure. Material requirements are critical only in those parts which come into
			direct contact with propellant gases. Other motor components can be made of
			conventional material.</p>

			<p>Once the wall material of an operating rocket engine begins to fail, final
			burn-through and engine destruction are extremely rapid. Even a small pinhole in the
			chamber wall will almost immediately (within one second) open into a large hole
			because the hot chamber gases (4000-6000 °F) will oxidize or melt the adjacent metal,
			which is then blown away exposing new metal to the hot gases.</p>

			<p>Exotic metals and difficult fabrication techniques are used in today's space and
			missile rocket engines, providing a lightweight structure absolutely required for
			efficient launch and flight vehicles. These advanced metals and fabrication
			techniques are far outside the reach of the serious amateur builder. However, the
			use of more commonplace (and much less expensive) metals and fabrication techniques
			is quite possible, except that a flightweight engine will not result. Since almost
			all amateur rocket firing should be conducted on a static test stand, this is not a
			severe restriction to the amateur builder. Experience with a wide variety of rocket
			engine designs leads to the following reconmendations for amateur rocket engines:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>The combustion chamber and nozzle should be machined in one piece, from
				copper.</li>
				<li>Those injector parts in contact with the hot chamber gases should also be
				machined from copper.</li>
				<li>The cooling jacket and those injector parts not in contact with the hot
				propellant gases, should be fabricated from brass or stainless steel.</li>
				<li>Expert machine and welding work is essential to produce a safe and useable
				rocket engine. Shoddy or careless workmanship, or poor welds, can easily cause
				engine failure.</li>
			</ol>

			<!-- CH 3.7 -->
			<h2 id="injectors">Injectors</h2>

			<p>The function of the injector is to introduce the propellants into the combustion
			chamber in such a way that efficient combustion can occur. There are two types of
			injectors which the amateur builder can consider for small engine design. One of
			these is the impinging stream injector in which the oxidizer and fuel are injected
			through a number of separate holes so that the resulting streams intersect with each
			other. The fuel stream will impinge with the oxidizer stream and both will break up
			into small droplets. When gaseous oxygen is used as the oxidizer, and a liquid
			hydrocarbon is used as fuel, the impingement of the liquid stream with the high
			velocity gas stream results in diffusion and vaporisation, causing good mixing and
			efficient combustion. A disadvantage of this type of injector is that extremely
			small holes are required for small engine flow rates and the hydraulic
			characteristics and equations normally used to predict injector parameters do not
			give good results for small orifices. The small holes are also difficult to drill,
			especially in soft copper.</p>

			<p>However, to provide a complete picture of the equations used in rocket engine
			design, we present below the equation for the flow of liquid through a simple
			orifice (a round drilled hole, for example)</p>

			<!-- w = Cd A SQRT(2g(rho)(deltaP))		(25) -->
			<div id="formula-26" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-26.png" alt="formula-26"></div>

			<p>
				where<br />
				w = propellant flow rate, lb/sec<br />
				A = area of orifice, ft<sup>2</sup><br />
				ΔP = pressure drop across orifice, psi<br />
				ρ = density of propellant, lb/ft<sup>3</sup><br />
				g = gravitational constant, 32.2 ft/sec<sup>2</sup><br />
				C<sub>d</sub> = orifice discharge coefficient<br />
			</p>

			<p>The discharge coefficient for a well-shaped simple orifice will usually have a
			value between 0.5 and 0.7.</p>

			<p>The injection velocity, or velocity of the liquid stream issuing from the
			orifice, is given by</p>

			<!-- v = Cd SQRT(2g((deltaP)/(rho)))		(26) -->
			<div id="formula-27" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-27.png" alt="formula-27"></div>

			<p>Injection pressure drops of 70 to 150 psi, or injection velocities of 50 to 100
			ft/sec are usually used in small liquid-fuel rocket engines. The injection pressure
			drop must be high enough to eliminate combustion instability inside the combustion
			chamber but must not be so high that the tankage and pressurization system used to
			supply fuel to the engine are penalized.</p>

			<p>A second type of injector is the spray nozzle in which conical, solid cone,
			hollow cone, or other type of spray sheet can be obtained. When a liquid hydrocarbon
			fuel is forced through a spray nozzle (similar to those used in home oil burners)
			the resulting fuel droplets are easily mixed with gaseous oxygen and the resulting
			mixture readily vaporized and burned. Spray nozzles are especially attractive for
			the amateur builder since several companies manufacture them commercially for oil
			burners and other applications. The amateur need only determine the size and spray
			characteristics required for his engine design and the correct spray nozzle can then
			be purchased at low cost. <a class="figure-link" href="#figure-7">Figure 7</a>
			illustrates the two types of injectors.</p>

			<p>The use of commercial spray nozzles for amateur built rocket engines is highly
			recommended.</p>

			<p>The water flow gap is 0.0425 inch.</p>

			<h3 id="example-step-14">Step 14</h3>

			<p>The fuel injector for this small rocket engine will be a
			commercial spray nozzle with a 75 degree spray angle. The required
			capacity of the nozzle is determined by the fuel flow rate</p>

			<!-- <p>w<sub>f</sub> = 0.022 lb/sec = 1.32 lb/ minute,</p> -->
			<div id="formula-54" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-54.png" alt="formula-54"></div>

			<p>Since there are six pounds of gasoline per gallon, the spray nozzle
			flow requirement is 0.22 gallon per minute (gpm). The spray nozzle
			can now be ordered from any of several suppliers (see List of
			Suppliers); nozzle material should be brass to ensure adequate
			injector heat transfer to the incoming propellant.</p>

			<p>If an impinging jet injector had been chosen, the
			determination of the required injector hole number and size would
			have been as follows:</p>

			<p>The flow area for fuel injection is given by Equation (<a class="formula-link" href="#formula-26">26</a>)</p>

			<!-- <p>A = w<sub>f</sub>/(C<sub>d</sub>) (2gρΔP)<sup>1/2</sup></p> -->
			<div id="formula-55" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-55.png" alt="formula-55"></div>

			<p>We will assume that C<sub>d</sub> = 0.7 with a fuel injection pressure drop

			<!-- <p>A = 0.000706 in<sup>2</sup></p> -->
			<div id="formula-57" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-57.png" alt="formula-57"></div>

			<p>If only one injection hole is used (a poor practice which can

			<!-- <p>D = (4Aπ)<sup>1/2</sup> = .0009<sup>1/2</sup> = 0.30 inch</p> -->
			<div id="formula-58" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-58.png" alt="formula-58"></div>

			<p>A number 69 drill could be used for this hole.</p>

			<p>If two injection holes are used, their diameter would be</p>

			<!-- <p>D = .00045<sup>1/2</sup> = 0.021 inch</p> -->
			<div id="formula-59" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-59.png" alt="formula-59"></div>

			<p>A number 75 drill could be used for these holes.</p>

			<h3 id="example-step-15">Step 15</h3>

			<p>The injection holes for the gaseous oxygen will be simple
			drilled orifices. The size of these orifices should be such that a
			gas stream velocity or about 200 ft/sec is obtained at design
			oxygen flow rate. The holes must not be so small that sonic velocity
			is achieved in the orifice passages since this would result in a high
			upstream pressure requirement to drive the required amount of oxygen
			through the orifices.</p>

			<p>If a spray nozzle fuel injector is used we will assume the use
			of four equally spaced oxygen injection ports parallel to the
			combustion chamber centerline around this nozzle. If we assume an
			injection pressure drop of 100 psi then the oxygen gas pressure at the
			entrance to the injection ports will be 400 psi (the chamber pressure
			plus the injection pressure drop). The density of gaseous oxygen at
			400 psi and a temperature of 68 °F is given by the perfect gas law
			(see <a class="table-link" href="#table-2">Table II</a>).</p>

			<!-- <p>ρ<sub>2</sub> = ρ<sub>1</sub>(P<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>1</sub>) = 2.26 lb/ft<sup>3</sup></p> -->
			<div id="formula-59" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-59.png" alt="formula-59"></div>

			<p>Assuming, incompressibility, the injection flow area is given by</p>

			<!-- <p>A = w<sub>o</sub>/ρv<sub>o</sub></p> -->
			<div id="formula-60" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-60.png" alt="formula-60"></div>

			<p>Since we know the oxygen flow rate and the desired injection
			velocity, we can easily find the total injection area</p>

			<!-- <p>A = .055/(2.26)(200) = 0.0001217 ft<sup>2</sup></p> -->

			<!-- <p>A = 0.0175 in<sup>2</sup></p> -->
			<div id="formula-62" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-62.png" alt="formula-62"></div>

			<p>Since there are to be four holes, each hole has an area of 0.004375

			<div id="formula-63" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-63.png" alt="formula-63"></div>

			<p>A number 48 drill could be used for these holes.</p>

			<p>These same size oxygen jets could also be used with two fuel
			jets in the impinging stream injector. The holes, oxygen and fuel,
			should be drilled at an angle of 45° with respect to the injector
			face with the intersection point of the streams about 1/4 inch inside

			<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

			<p>The foregoing design calculations provide the dimensions,
			thicknesses, and orifice sizes for the major components of our rocket
			engine. The actual design of the engine, however, requires engineering
			judgment and knowledge of machining, welding, and operational factors
			since these interact to determine the final configuration of the
			engine and its components. Perhaps the best way to accomplish the
			final design is to sit down with appropriate drafting materials and
			begin to draft a cross-section view of the engine. A scale of 2/1 (or
			twice actual size) is about right for these small engines and will
			enable the designer to better visualize the entire assembly.</p>
			
			<p>Using the dimensions obtained in the example calculation, and
			the design technique described shove, the rocket engine assembly
			design shown in <a class="figure-link" href="#figure-8">Figure 8</a> is obtained.
			The engine design features easy fabrication and assembly.</p>

			<!-- CH 5.0 -->
			<h1 id="fabrication">Fabrication</h1>

			<p>The fabrication and assembly of a small liquid fuel rocket engine is no more
			difficult than the more serious amateur machine projects, such as model steam
			engines, gasoline engines, and turbines. Because the rocket engine has no rotating
			parts, dynamic balance of components is not required. However, the use of quality,
			homogeneous materials and careful fabrication technique are definitely required to
			produce a safe, working rocket engine.</p>

			<p>A properly designed small liquid-fuel rocket engine requires the following
			machine and hand tools:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>6" or 10" metal-turning lathe, with attachments</li>
				<li>Precision drill press</li>
				<li>hand files, calipers, micrometers, etc.</li>
				<li>oxy-acetylene torch or small arc welder.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Since a properly designed engine will have symmetrical parts, a milling machine
			or planer will not be required. The metal-turning lathe should have a repeatable
			accuracy of 0.001 inch. The drill press will be used to drill small diameter holes
			and should have a true running, high speed chuck.</p>

			<p>Mensuration equipment such as calipers, micrometers, etc., must be capable of
			inside and outside diameter measurements, lengths, and should be used to locate
			holes, recesses, and other features prior to actual machining.</p>

			<p>The joining of the various engine components is especially critical since the
			engine will operate at high pressure and high temperature.</p>

			</div>

			<p>The ability of the welder, and the welding techniques employed, should be as good
			as those required for aircraft work. Metal joints must be clean, with a close fit
			between parts to ensure adequate weld strength and integrity. To the extent possible
			assembled components should be tested with water (or nitrogen gas, but that is
			dangerous) prior to actual use with propellants. Repair of leaks or initially poor
			welds must be carefully done with subsequent re-testing with pressurized water
			(called hydro-testing or hydrostatic testing).</p>

			<p>As discussed previously, the combustion chamber should built as a one-piece unit.
			This arrangement, while more difficult from a machining point of view, eliminates
			the requirement for a joint of some kind between the two parts; this joint would be
			exposed to the hot combustion gases (5700 °F) on one side and would, in all
			probability, fail. Building the combustion chamber and nozzle in one piece
			eliminates this potential failure point. Care must be exercised during the machining
			of the copper chamber/nozzle to ensure constant wall thickness and the correct taper
			in the nozzle region. Thin wall sections are potential failure points and could
			result in almost immediate catastrophic failure during firing.</p>

			<p>Machining of the outer shell or jacket is less critical than the combustion
			chamber/nozzle. Typical materials for this part are stainless steel or brass. The
			inside diameter of the shell should have a smooth finish to reduce cooling pressure
			drop, nnd the outside finish of the shell, which will be visible to the world,
			should reflect the care and concern of the machinist. The shell will also contain
			the coolant entry and exit ports. Since the coolant (typically water) will probably
			have an entry pressure of 60 to 100 psi, these ports and fittings should be
			constructed with some care. The use of flare type fittings with metal tapered seats
			(such as those manufactured by Parker or Weatherland) is highly recomended. The
			shell will also feature a method of attaching the injector and for mounting the
			engine to a test or thrust stand. As shown in
			<a class="figure-link" href="#figure-8">Figure 8</a>, these two mounting
			requirements can be easily combined to simplify the design. The forces to be
			considered when designing the shell are not the thrust forces (which are small,
			typically on the order of 20-30 lbs) but, rather the pressure forces attempting to
			separate the injector from the shell. The pressure acting on the injector area out
			to the point of sealing between the injector and the outer shell is the combustion
			chamber pressure, which is typically 100 to 300 psi. The force attempting to
			separate the injector from the shell is slightly over 600 lbs for the design shown
			in <a class="figure-link" href="#figure-8">Figure 8</a> at a combustion pressure of
			300 psi. The bolts holding the two components together (and in this case also
			holding the assembly to the test mount) must withstand this force with and adequate
			safety factor (typically a factor of two). The number and size of bolts required can
			be obtained from <a class="table-link" href="#table-4">Table IV</a>, which gives the
			average load capacity of high strength steel bolts of various sizes. The strength of
			these bolts, however, depends to some extent on the adequacy of the threads in
			tapped holes, the tapped material, and the bolt tightening procedure used in
			assembly.</p>

			<p>The outer shell must also contain a sealing device to prevent the high pressure
			combustion chamber gas from flowing back past the injector. With an appropriately
			configured water-cooled design, the use of an elastomeric O-ring is highly
			desirable. A standard neoprene O-ring (manufactured by a number of companies, see
			<a href="#list-of-suppliers">List of Suppliers</a>) will give reliable service if
			the surrounding metal does not exceed a temperature of 200-300 °F . Dimensions and
			design parameters for O-rings and O-ring grooves are given in manufacturers supply
			catalogs.</p>

			<p>Another method of sealing is the use of an asbestos-copper crush gasket (very
			similar to those used on automobile spark plugs, only larger; see
			<a href="#list-of-suppliers">List of Suppliers</a>). The copper crush gasket is
			positioned by a V-groove cut in the surface of the outer jacket at the sealing
			point. The mating surface of the injector should be smooth and flat with no machine
			marks.</p>

			<p>Figure <a class="figure-link" href="#figure-9">9</a> illustrates the relationship between an O-ring and a copper crush gasket
			and their mating surfaces.</p>

				gasket.</span>
			</div>

			<p>The injector should be fabricated from copper to provide maximum heat transfer
			from the injector face to the incoming propellants. The outer shell of the injector
			can be made from either copper, stainless steel, or brass. However, since the
			propellant inlet fittings (again these should be the tapered seat, metal-to-metal
			kind) should be stainless steel for best results. It is usually a good idea to make
			the injector outer shell from stainless steel so that the inlet fittings can be arc
			welded. Then the outer shell can be attached to the remainder of the injector by
			silver brazing without weakening the inlet fitting welds.</p>

			<p>Injection holes for the gaseous oxygen (and for the fuel, if impinging jets are
			used) will usually be made with numbered drills of small diameter. Extreme care
			should be used in drilling these holes, especially in soft copper. The drilled hole
			should have an entry and exit free from burrs or chips. It is vitally important that
			injector components be thoroughly cleaned and deburred prior to assembly. After
			injector welding, hot water should be used to thoroughly clean the injector assembly
			of brazing flux and residues, and the assembly should receive a final rinse in
			acetone or alcohol.</p>

			<h1 id="testing-equipment">Testing Equipment</h1>

			<p>In this section we shall discuss the auxilliary equipment 
			needed to operate the rocket engine, the installation of this
			equipment, and its safe use in engine operation.</p>

			<!-- CH 6.1 -->
			<h2 id="feed-system">Feed System</h2>

			<p>The feed system for amateur rocket engine testing consists of
			a tank to store the liquid fuel, a regulated supply of high pressure
			nitrogen gas to force the fuel from the tank into the engine, a
			regulated supply of high pressure gaseous oxygen, and a control device
			for regulating the propellant flow rates. A typical pressurizing feed
			system is shown schematically in
			<a class="figure-link" href="#figure-10">Figure 10</a>.</p>

			<!-- CH 6.2 -->
			<h2 id="feed-system-components">Feed System Components</h2>

			<p>The components of a rocket engine feed system are precision
			instruments designed to handle gas and/or liquids at high pressure.
			While many of the components suitable for use in amateur rocket 
			feed systems are readily available from welding or automohile parts
			suppliers, they are usually relatively expensive. The amateur
			builder should expect the assembly of the feed system to be an 
			expensive project which, however, need be done only once. The use of
			quality products, made to do the job or very carefully modified and
			pre-tested, is mandatory for safe operation of amateur rocket engines.</p>

			<!-- CH 6.2.1 -->
			<h3 id="high-pressure-gas-cylinders">High Pressure Gas Cylinders</h3>

			<p>Gases stored in cylinders at high pressure (usually about 1800
			psi) are readily obtained from any bottled gas supplier or from many
			welding suppliers. Special fittings with nonstandard threads are used
			to prevent use of incorrect equipment with the cylinders. Although
			cylinders can be purchased, they are usually rented and then returned
			to the supplier for recharge at a nominal fee. High pressure gas
			cylinders should never he dropped or mishandled. Cylinders should be
			stored so they cannot fall over or inadvertently roll; the best way of
			securing is to chain or strap the cylinders to an appropriate stand or
			worktable. When cylinders are not in use the cap should be kept on to
			protect the cylinder valve. Several suppliers of high pressure gases
			publish instruction books on the care and use of high pressure
			cylinders (see <a href="#bibliography">Bibliography</a>); the amateur is
			encouraged to read and follow these professional instructions.</p>

			<h3 id="gaseous-nitrogen">Gaseous Nitrogen</h3>

			<p>Nitrogen is an inert gas compatible with all normally available
			materials. The amateur builder will have little dificulty with
			materials of construction for nitrogen but must be careful that all
			components are suitable for high pressure service. Cleanliness of
			components is important for proper and reliable operation.</p>

			<!-- CH 6.2.3 -->
			<h3 id="gaseous-oxygen">Gaseous Oxygen</h3>

			<p>Oxygen will not itself burn but does vigorously support the rapid
			combustion of almost all other materials. The amateur must be
			concerned not only with suitablility of components for high pressure
			service but also must use only components that are made from oxygen
			compatible materials and that are cleaned for oxygen service. All
			items, including lines, fittings, valves, regulators, etc., MUST be
			absolutely free from oil, grease, and similar contaminants. Thorough
			cleaning of all items in solvent, followed by a complete rinse in
			acetone, is an absolute must. Orders for commercial items should he
			marked to indicate their intended use with high pressure gaseous
			oxygen. Many commercial suppliers of valves and regulators offer a
			special service for cleaning their products for oxygen service. The
			amateur should avail himself of these services whenever possible, even
			though they will add slightly to the initial cost of the component.</p>

			<p>When cleaning components with solvent or acetone, the amateur
			builder should observe all rules of safety applying to these
			chemicals. They are toxic and easily ignited. Cleaning should be
			done outside and away from huildings, fires, or other possible
			ignition sources. These fluids should not be stored indoors but in
			vented lockers away from main buildings.</p>

			<!-- CH 6.2.4 -->
			<h3 id="fuel-tank">Fuel Tank</h3>

			<p>The fuel tank is a closed vessel which contains the liquid fuel
			at moderate pressure (300-500 psi). Tanks of various sizes and
			shapes, made from carbon- or stainless steel, are offered to the
			public from war surplus outlets. The amateur builder should be very
			careful if he decides to use such a tank. They should not be modified
			since in nearly all cases they are thin wall pressure vessels made for
			aircraft service, and additional outlets or welding to the tank wall
			could seriously weaken the tank. In all cases the tank should be
			hydrostatically tested to at least 1 1/2 times desired operating
			presure before use in the rocket engine feed system.</p>

			<p>The amateur may build (or have built) a tank especially for his
			requirements. Seamless tubing or pipe (mild steel or stainless steel)
			with welded flat end plates makes an excellent tank. Outlet ports are
			easily tapped in the flat end plates, The tank wall thickness is given
			by <a class="formula-link" href="#formula-22">Equation (22)</a></p>

			 <!-- t_w = PD/2S -->
			 <div id="formula-65" class="formula"><img src="formulas/formula-65.png" alt="formula-65"></div>


			<p>where P is the pressure in the tank (1 1/2 times the desired
			operating pressure), D is the outside diameter of the tank, t_w is the
			wall thickness, and S is the allowable stress. The size of the tank is
			determined by the size of the rocket engine and the desired operating
			time. The engine discussed in Example Design Calculation had a fuel
			flow rate of 0.022 lb/sec. A tank with a 4-inch inside diameter and 12
			inches long would hold enough gasoline to run this engine for 175
			seconds. If the tank outside diameter is 4.5 inches, the allowable
			stress in the steel is 20,000 psi, and the operating pressure is 500
			psi so that the design pressure is 750 psi, a tank minimum wall
			thickness of 0.085 inch is calculated. A wall thickness of 0.250 inch
			is chosen to allow for welding factors, stress concentrations, and the
			size of available seamless tubing. The tank inside diameter is 4.0
			inches. The flat end plates for this tank should be at least twice the
			thickness of the tank wall (i.e. for this case, at least 1/2 inch
			thick). Drilling and tapping should be done prior to welding, to
			prevent oil and metal chips from falling into the tank. Welding
			should be done by an expert with several passes for each end plate
			(see <a class="figure-link" href="#figure-11">Figure 11</a>). End plate ports
			should then be re-tapped. The tank should be thoroughly cleaned and hydrostatically
			tested prior to use in the rocket engine feed system.</p>

			<p>The fuel tank should contain enough ports, or the tank
			plumbing should be so arranged, that a safety relief valve (either
			spring loaded or a burst disc), gas inlet port, load and vent port,
			and fuel outlet and drain are available. Many of these functions can
			be incorporated as part of the gas inlet and fuel outlet plumbing so
			that only two ports, one on each end of the tank are required.</p>

				used to attach the end plates to the seamless tubing.</span>
			</div>

			<p>Tanks made from seamless tubing should not be greater than six
			inches in diameter; wall stress is a function of diameter, and at high
			stress, specialized design information, not usually available to the
			amateur builder, is required. Also, the force on the tank end plates
			increases rapidly with tank diameter.</p>

			<!-- CH 6.2.5 -->
			<h3 id="gaseous-nitrogen-regulator">Gaseous Nitrogen Regulator</h3>

			<p>The purpose of a regulator is to maintain a constant pressure
			on the downstream side of the regulator as the pressure in the gas
			cylinder on the upstream side decreases. A good quality regulator
			will maintain the downstream pressure quite accurately over a range
			of gas flow rates as long as the upstream cylinder pressure does not
			decrease so as to become too close to the downstream pressure. Thus, 
			all the gas in the cylinder is not usable since some excess pressure 
			(hence, gas) is required to drive the gas through, and maintain control 
			of, the regulator. The flow rate of nitrogen gas required for the
			fuel from the tank is relatively small and could be handled by a
			regular gaseous oxygen welding regulator equipped with nitrogen
			cylinder fittings. However, most welding regulators do not permit
			adjustment to the high downstream pressure required for rocket engine
			operation. A number of commercial firms (see
			<a href="#list-of-suppliers">List of Suppliers</a>) market
			regulators for non-welding purposes that are admirably suited for
			fuel tank pressurization. Especially attractive is the Grove Mity-Mite
			regulator with internal regulation. Inexpensive, special fittings are
			required to attach these regulators to the gas cylinder. These
			fittings are available from several sources (see
			<a href="#list-of-suppliers">List of Suppliers</a>).</p>

			<!-- CH 6.2.6 -->
			<h3 id="gaseous-oxygen-regulator">Gaseous Oxygen Regulator</h3>

			<p>The discussion of regulators for gaseous nitrogen service applies to
			gaseous oxygen also, except that the regulator should be especially
			cleaned for oxygen service and, if possible, metal-to-metal seats
			should be used within the regulator. Regulator manufacturers should
			be consulted for reccomendations on seat materials for use with
			gaseous oxygen in their regulators. Special fittings for attaching
			the regulator to the oxygen cylinder are available from the sources
			supplying nitrogen cylinder fittings. These sources can also supply
			cylinder manifold kits so that two or more oxygen cylinders can be
			used simultaneously to achieve long engine run durations.</p>

			<!-- CH 6.2.7 -->
			<h3 id="propellant-control-valves">Propellant Control Valves</h3>

			<p>The propellant control valves allow the operator to start and
			then manually remote-control the flow of each propellant in to the
			rocket engine. These valves should be stainless steel needle valves
			with Teflon packing or seals. Many manufacturers make this kind of
			valve (see <a href="#list-of-suppliers">List of Suppliers</a>). The valve for
			gaseous oxygen shoud be larger than the valve for the fuel line. Engines of the size
			discussed in Example Design Calculation should use a 1/4-inch ftel
			valve (that is, 1/4 National Pipe Thread line size) and a 1/2-inch
			oxygen valve. The tubing actnally entering, and leaving, the valves
			need not be this large, but the valves themselves should be as
			indicated to afford a range of flow control with minimum pressure drop
			across the valve. Since these valves control the flow of propellants,
			they should be mounted near the tanks and engine on the test stand,
			and operated remotely by means of valve stem extensions (see
			discussion on Test Stand).</p>

			<!-- CH 6.2.8 -->
			<h3 id="other-valves">Other Valves</h3>

			<p>Other valves required in the feed system include the fuel tank
			vent and fill valve, the drain valve, and the nitrogen purge valve.
			Inexpensive, high quality ball valves are highly reccomended for these
			functions since they offer positive shut-off, easy operation with
			handle indication of on or off, and full line opening. Brass or
			stainless steel valve bodies with Teflon seats are acceptable, and the
			valves may be line or panel mounted (see
			<a href="#list-of-suppliers">List of Suppliers</a>).</p>

			<h3 id="check-valves">Check Valves</h3>

			<p>Check valves permit fluid flow in one direction only. They are
			widely used in the aircraft and hydraulic industry and are
			manufactured by many companies. l/4-inch line size is recommended for
			all functions shown in <a class="figure-link" href="#figure-10">Figure 10</a> with
			the exception of the gaseous oxygen line check valve which should feature
			metal-to-metal seats and be at least 3/8 inch line size. Check valves should be
			thoroughly cleaned prior to use and tested to insure that tlle check is working
			properly.</p>

			<h3 id="relief-valves">Relief Valves</h3>

			<p>The fuel tank requires a relief device of some type to prevent
			tank failure in the event of over-pressurization. While this is high
			unlikely, it could happen if the gaseous nitrogen regulator failed to
			function or shut-off properly. An adjustable spring-loaded relief
			valve is reccomended because it may be set to different pressures as
			feed system uses change, and because, if used, does not have to be
			replaced. An alternate device is the burst disc which ruptures at a
			preset pressure and relieves the overpressure in the tank. Burst
			discs require replacement after actuation and are not pressure
			adjustable. A different disc must be used for each pressure range
			desired.</p>

			<h3 id="fiel-filter">Fuel Filter</h3>

			<p>Fuel injection holes on small liquid-fuel rocket engines are
			easily plugged with contaminants from tbe fuel tank and control
			system. A fuel filter which can filter out particles down to ten
			microns in size is highly reccommended and will save the amateur
			builder much grief when actual testing is started. Several concerns
			make small filters suitable for rocket engine feed systems (see
			<a href="#list-of-suppliers">List of Suppliers</a>).</p>

			<h3 id="pressure-cauges">Pressure Gauges</h3>

			<p>Fuel, oxygen, water, and combustion chamber pressure are
			essential measurements for rocket engine operation. Buordon-tube
			pressure gauges offer accuracy, ruggedness, low cost, and availability
			for this requirement. Numerous manufacturers make these gauges in a
			bewildering variety of styles, sizes, and prices. Bronze Bourdon
			tubes are recommended since they are fully compatible (when cleaned)
			with gaseous oxygen or hydrocarbon fuel and are so widely used that
			significant cost savings are possible.</p>

			<p>Small (2 1/2 or 3-inch diameter) high pressure gauges similar to
			those used on oxygen welding regulators should be used by the amateur
			builder for measuring pressure in the high pressure gas cylinders or
			manifolds. These gauges can be obtained from a welding supply shop.</p>

			<p>Gauges for fuel, oxygen, water, and combustion chamber pressure
			should be at least 3 1/2 inch diameter for easv reading, from a
			distance. These 3 1/2 Acaloy gauges of Helicoid (see
			<a href="#list-of-suppliers">List of Suppliers</a>) are recommended because of their
			reliability and low cost. These gauges are easily panel mounted and make a neat test
			stand installation.</p>

			<h3 id="plumbing">Plumbing</h3>

			<p>Plumbing refers to tbe flow tubes and fittings used to collnect
			the components discussed previously. 1/4-inch diameter stainless steel
			tubing for the fuel and nitrogen systems and 3/8 inch diameter
			stainless tubing for the oxygen line are recommended. Flare fittings
			with metal to metal seats are also recommended for joining the tubing
			to other components. 1/4 and 3/8 inch diameter copper tubing can also
			be used for the fuel, oxygen, and nitrogen supply system but is not as
			desirable as stainless steel and is more easily flared. The amateur
			builder should use only good flaring tools and should form or bend
			tubing only with a tube bender. Where the fittings screw into fuel
			tank, valve, or other components having pipe threads, the use of
			Teflon tape on the threads is recommended. No other pipe thread
			compound should be used, especially on gaseous oxygen components.</p>


			<!-- CH 7.0 -->
			<h2 id="test-stand">Test Stand</h2>

			<p>The amateur rocket engine test stand is a structure which incorporates a 
			method for firmly mounting the rocket engine (preferably in a nozzle-down 
			attitude), a mounting for the propellant flow control needle valves, the 
			fuel tank and associated plumbing, and the oxygen and nitrogen cylinders 
			with regulators and associated plumbing. The operator's station, which
			is really a part of the test stand, should be physically separated from 
			the test stand proper by at least 20 feet, witll a shrapnel barricade 
			between. The operator's station should contain the control valve extensions,
			the ignition system battery and associated switches, and a mirror system 
			so that the operator does not directly view the operating rocket engine.</p>
			
			<p>The greatest hazard in testing small rocket engines is from shrapnel 
			in the event of engine explosion or disintigration. Therefore, the test 
			stand proper should be suitably barricaded to reduce shrapnel effect 
			in all directions.</p>


			<div id="figure-12" class="fig">

				<span class="caption"><span class="fig-text">Figure 12</span>
				Test stand for small liquid-fuel rocket engines.</span>
			</div>

			<p><a class="figure-link" href="#figure-12">Figure 12</a> shows schematically the
			proper arrangement of components for a safe rocket engine test stand. The rocket
			engine is separated from the propellant flow control valves by a 1/8-inch thick
			steel barricade. The engine is firmly attached to a section of steel
			channel in the nozzle down position. This is the safest orientation
			for a liquid-fuel rocket engine since excess fuel, in the event of an
			ignition failure, simply drains out of the engine nozzle. The engine
			is mounted high enough from the ground so that no flame chute or other
			complicated exhaust deflector or fixture is required. The compressed
			gas cylinders (one nitrogen and two oxygen) are mounted at the rear of
			the test stand and are separated from the control valves compartment
			by another barricade made from one-inch thick plywood. The nitrogen
			and oxygen regulators are mounted on this plywood barricade above the
			cylinders. In this manner, expended cylinders may he replaced with
			charged cylinders without disturbing the regulators or plumbing. A
			formed piece of stainless steel tubing between the oxygen manifold and
			the oxygen regulator and a similar piece of tubing between the
			nitrogen cylinder and its regulator are removed during cylinder
			exchange, and then reconnected. Lines should always be capped when not
			in use to prevent entry of dirt and other foreign objects.</p>

			<p>The fuel tank is mounted beteeen the forward steel barricade and
			the rear plywood barricade on a metal cross-piece attached to both
			barricades. The tank is mounted in the vertical position with the
			liquid outlet at the bottom.</p>

			<p>The propellant flow control valves are mounted one atop the other
			in a metal bracket which is attached to the forward steel barricade.
			Panel mounted needle valves are recommended since they facilitate
			mounting in the manner described, and do not place mounting or
			operating stresses on the propellant flow tubing. Valve stem
			extensions, made from 1/4-inch pipe permit operation of the control
			valves from the operator's remote control station, which is located at
			least twenty feet from the test stand proper. Pressure gauges for fuel
			tank pressure, oxygen line pressure, cooling water exit pressure and
			combustion chamber pressure are mounted in a panel which is attached
			to the forward and rear barricades and which faces the operator's
			remote station.</p>

			<p>Cooling water for the rocket engine is brought into a hose
			coupling attached to the stand, with semi-permanent plumbing between
			the coupling and the rocket engine. Water flowing from the cooling
			jacket should be directed away from the engine or can be directed
			downward onto a 3-inch deep layer of coarse stones laid beneath the
			roeket engine exhaust. These stones will prevent the engine exhaust
			from picking up dirt and dust; the water will cool the stones and
			extend their useful life. The jet of cooling water can be observed by
			the operator as an indication that cooling water is actually flowing
			through the engine.</p>

			<p>The test stand proper should have a framework made from welded or
			bolted steel angle. The forward steel and rear plywood barricade are
			bolted to this angle framework providing rigidity and strength. The
			test stand should be firmly attached to the surface of the test area
			either by bolting to a concrete pad or by weighing down with sand bags
			or concrete weights.</p>

			<!-- CH 8.0 -->
			<h1 id="safety">Safety</h1>

			<p>Because of the physical hazards involved in handling propellants
			and controlling high pressure combustion proeesses, certain elementary
			safety precautions must be observed in static testing of rocket
			engines. During the design, and later, the operation of amateur liquid
			rocket engines, the following general safety precautions should be
			observed:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>The operator should be protected by a suitable barricade located
				some distance (at least 20 feet) from the test unit.</li>

				<li>Control of valves during engine ignition and steady-state
				operation should be by remote means, which for amateur units is best
				achieved by manual control of needle valves via valve stem extensions.</li>

				<li>A large chemical fire extinguisher (or, at least, a plentiful
				supply of water) should always be on hand.</li>

				<li>The operator should not view the test unit directly, but should
				use a mirror arrangement (somewhat like a periscope) or use a thick
				layer of reinforced safety glass attached to the operator's
				barricade. REMEMBER, the primary danger is from shrapnel in the event
				of engine explosion.</li>

				<li>Separating of fuel and oxidizer storage reduces the fire and
				explosion hazard and limits the amount of propellant stowed in any one
				area.</li>

				<li>The test stand unit should be barricaded on several sides to
				reduce shrapnel effect in event of explosion.</li>

				<li>Valves, pressure gauges, and other components which directly
				sense fluid properties should not be located in the operator's
				station, but should be on the test stand and remotely read. This rule
				does not apply to electrical instrumentation wherein a transducer is
				located on the test stand and an electrical readout (such as a meter)
				is located at the operator's station (this type of instrumentation is
				very expensive and is beyond the reach of most amateurs
				[see <a href="#additions-and-corrections">Additions and Corrections</a>]).</li>

				<li>Warning signals should be given prior to tests (or whenever gas
				cylinder valves are open) to notify personnel that the area is
				hazardous. A test must <strong>NEVER</strong> be conducted until the operator
				has assured himself that all personnel are behind safety barricades or
				otherwise protected.</li>

				<li>Personnel should be permitted to work in the test area only if
				fuel and oxidizer are separated and not pressurized.</li>

				<li>Personnel handling propellants should wear safety equipment such
				as gloves, face shields, or rubber aprons. Remember that most fuels
				are toxic; do not breathe fuel vapors for even a short time.</li>

				<li>No smoking is ever permitted anywhere near a test area when
				propellants are alse present, Remember vapors from hydrocarbon fuels
				(such as gasoline) can travel long distances from the test area and
				can be ignited at a remote point travelling back to the test stand.</li>

				<li>A check-off list is helpful when conducting a rocket engine
				firing and should be made up of both technical events and safety items
				to be completed prior to the firing.</li>
			</ol>

			<!-- CH 9.0 -->
			<h1 id="engine-check-out-and-calibration">Engine Check-Out and Calibration</h1>

			<p>After the rocket engine has been fabricated, several
			check-out tests and flow calibrations should be made prior to
			testing with live propellants.</p>

			<!-- CH 9.1 -->
			<h2 id="leak-testing">Leak Testing</h2>

			<p>Connect the engine cooling jacket to a readily available
			source of pressurized water (such as lawn or house supply; pressure
			should be 50-100 psi with no flow). Attach a pressure gauge to the
			outlet port of the jacket and open the water valve, allowing water to
			fill the jacket. Observe the jacket and engine for leaks. There should
			be no leaks.</p>

			<p>A similar pressure check should be performed on the fuel
			manifold of the injector. Since the injector face is not easily
			blanked off, perform this test by flowing water through the
			injector. Use a filter in the vater line to avoid plugging the small
			fuel injection holes. Use a pressure gauge attached to the water line
			as near to the injector fuel entry port as possible. There should be
			no leaks.</p>

			<!-- CH 9.2 -->
			<h2 id="flow-calibration">Flow Calibration</h2>

			<p>The water flow rate through the engine cooling jacket should be
			determined for various inlet pressures. Use a bathroom or other
			available scale to weigh, in a container, water flowing through the
			engine over a timed period. Water pressure can be measured either at
			the entrance or exit of the cooling jacket. Attach a flexible hose
			(garden variety will do) to the outlet of the cooling jacket and start
			water flowing through the jacket at the desired pressure. Once steady
			flow has been achieved quickly move the hose outlet into the catch
			container for a period of 30 seconds, then quickly remove the hose
			from the container. Use a stop or sweep second watch for the timing
			and be accurate! Obtain the net weight of collected water by
			subtracting from the weight of the filled container its empty weight.
			Divide the net weight by the time during which water was collected and
			the result will be water flow rate in lb/sec. This operation should be
			repeated several times at different pressures to obtain the flow
			characteristics of the coolant jacket. If insufficient water pressure
			is available to achieve the design water flow rate, check the size of
			tubing or hose used between the water source and the engine; it may be
			restricting the water flow rate. Check also the size of the flexible
			duct hose used. If these tests show that greater pressure is required
			to achieve the desired flow rate, a different source of cooling water
			may be required. Under extreme conditions, an air-presurized water
			tank or a motor-driven pump may be required. Another solution is to
			disassemble the engine and re-bore the outer shell to open up the
			water flow passage. Material should NOT be removed from the
			combustion chamber/nozzle.</p>

			<p>Flow rate tests of the injector, using water, can be performed in
			a manner similar to the cooling system calibration, although their
			worth is questionable. The flow characteristics of water and the
			hydrocarbon fuels are different, so that a water calibration is not
			directly comparable to what will occur when fuel is used. However, the
			pressure drop required to flow a given quantity of water will provide
			some indication of how closely design objectives were achieved. This
			test should be conducted in the same manner as the cooling water
			calibration test except that the flow time should he long enough to
			accumulate at least ten pounds of water.</p>

			<!-- CH 9.3 -->
			<h2 id="leak-testing">Test Stand Checkout</h2>

			<p>After the test stand and operator's area are completed and
			components installed, tests should the conducted to determine that no
			gas or liquid leaks will occur when actual propellants are used. Fill
			the tank with clean water. Cap off the fuel and oxygen lines where
			they would normally attach to the engine. Pressurize the system to 100
			psi and check for leaks. A soap solution can be used to check around
			all fittings and seals. Soap bubbles indicate the presence of a gas
			leak. If no leaks are present, increase the pressure to 200 psi and
			repeat the detection procedure. Continue this procedure until the test
			stand operating pressure is reached and no leaks are present.
			Depressurize the system and refill the fuel tank with clean water.
			Attach the rocket engine to its test mount and connect all
			tubing. Pressurize the stand in the normal manner and practice the
			ignition and operating sequence using water as fuel (gaseous oxygen
			can safely he used in these tests, if desired). If no leaks develop,
			empty the fuel tank of water and dry by flushing with nitrogen gas for
			several seconds. The engine and test stand are now ready for their
			first hot firing.</p>

			<!-- CH 10.0 -->
			<h1 id="ignition-and-operation">Ignition and Operation</h1>

			<p>Discussion of propellant ignition has been reserved until this
			point since it is really a test stand function and is required only
			for actual operation of the engine. The propellants used in amateur
			rocket engines require a separate source for ignition. Because the
			engines are small, the use of an engine-mounted spark plug is not
			generally feasible. Even if it were, the ignition of incoming
			propellants in the combustion chamber by a small spark plug is
			dangerous and unreliable. Propellant timing is extremely important in
			a bi-propellant liquid rocket engine. An excess of either propellant
			(if both are liquid) in the combustion chamber can lead to severe
			over-pressure upon ignition (known as "hard" start) and possible
			fracture of the combustion chamber. The amateur engine using gaseous
			oxygen is not nearly as sensitive to hard starts as if the oxidizer
			were a liquid.</p>

			<p>Hundreds of tests with small liquid-fuel rocket engines employing
			gaseous oxygen as the oxidizer have indicated that hot-source ignition
			provides excellent propellant ignition characteristics, and
			drastically reduces hard starts. Hot-source ignition works as follows:
			two lengths of insulated #16 or #18 solid wire are taped together and
			their exposed ends are bent to form a spark gap of about 3/32-inch. A
			small amount of cotton is wrapped around, or attached to, thc wires
			very near the spark gap but not obstructing it. This ignition assembly
			is pushed through the nozzle into the combustion chamber of the rocket
			engine so that the spark gap is in the lower end of the combustion
			chamber but not blocking the nozzle throat. The wires outside the
			engine are bent or taped to hold the ignition assembly in position
			during the ignition phase. The free ends of the two wires are attached
			to the spark source (a Ford Model-T spark coil is ideal for this
			purpose). <a class="figure-link" href="#figure-13">Figure 13</a> details this
			hot-source igniter. The ignition procedure, after the test stand is prepared for
			firing is:</p>

			<div id="figure-13" class="fig">
				<div class="img"><div class="img"><img src="img/fig-13.png" alt="figure-13" /></div></div>
				<span class="caption"><span class="fig-text">Figure 13</span>
				Hot-source igniter for small liquid fuel rocket
				engines using gaseous oxygen oxidizer. Ignitor is consumed during each
				use and must be replaced.</span>
			</div>

			<ol>
				<li>The operator ascertains that the area is clear and ready for
				firing.</li>

				<li>The operator checks operation of the spark coil and then
				disconnects the coil from the battery for safety. The battery should
				be at the operator's remote station.</li>

				<li>The ignitor cotton is soaked in gasoline or kerosene.</li>

				<li>The ignitor is pushed through the nozzle into the combustion
				chamber and secured.</li>

				<li>Gas cylinder valves are opened, the fuel tank is pressurized,
				and all gas pressures adjusted to operating values.</li>

				<li>Cooling water is allowed to flow through the engine at the
				proper rate.</li>

				<li>The firing bell or horn is sounded. The spark coil is
				reconnected to its battery.</li>

				<li>The oxygen flow needle valve is opened very slightly to allow a
				very small flow of gaseous oxygen to pass over the ignitor and out the
				combustion chamber.</li>

				<li>The spark coil is energized. Inside the combustion chamber the
				cotton igitor should immediately burst into flame in the oxygen
				atmosphere. The operator may have difficulty ascertaining that the
				cotton is actually burning although small flaming bits of material may
				be ejected from the nozzle.</li>

				<li>The fuel control needle valve is now opened very slightly to
				allow fuel to flow into the combustion chamber. A flame should
				immediately appear at the nozzle exit and a low whistling sound should
				be heard.</li>

				<li>The oxygen and fuel flow rates should now be rapidly and 
				simultaneously increased by opening the control needle valves until tie 
				combustion chamber pressure gauge indicates that desired conditions 
				Exist inside the chamber.</li>

				<li>The operator will need to judge whether more or less oxygen is
				required for desired O/F ratio operation. More oxygen is required if
				the exhaust is bright yellow or smoky. (this is an indication of
				unburned carbon in the exhaust); if the exhaust is transparent or
				bluish the oxygen flow should he decreased slightly. The correct
				mixture ratio is achieved when the exhaust gases are transparent (or
				nearly so) but the supersonic standing shocks (Mach diamonds) in the
				exhaust are clearly seen. Remember that as you vary the fuel and
				oxidizer flows you are changing not only the amount of material
				passing through the engine but are also affecting the temperature of
				the burning gases. Both of these effects will affect the combustion
				chamber pressure.</li>

				<li>The noise from the engine will he quite high, but it is a good
				indicator of engine operation. It may be necessary to wear ear
				protection because of this high noise level.</li>

				<li>The operator should have a timer or have someone time the engine
				run. It is quite safe to simply let the engine run out of liquid
				fuel. The gaseous nitrogen pressurizing the fuel tank then purges the
				fuel supply system automatically. The engine will abruptly stop
				operation and the operator can then turn off the flow of gaseous
				oxygen. If the engine is to be stopped prior to fuel depletion the
				fuel flow control valve should be quickly turned off, followed by
				opening of the nitrogen purge valve. After the engine has stopped
				operation (thus assuring that the nitrogen purge has forced all fuel
				from the engine) the gaseous oxygen valve may be turned off. The
				nitrogen purge valve is closed, the cylinder valves are closcd, and
				the fuel tank vent valve opened. The oxygen line is vented by briefly
				opening the oxygen flow need1e valve. Water should be allowed to flow
				through the engine cooling jacket for several minutes after run
				termination.</li>

				<li>In the event of engine failure, the shutdown sequence detailed in 
				(14), above, should be followed. Always shut-off the liquid fuel first. 
				If engine metal parts are burning, also immediately shut-off the flow of 
				gaseous oxygen (metal will burn vigorously in an oxygen environment).</li>

				<li>A new ignitor will be required for each ignition attempt or firing. 
				The ignitor assembly is partially consumed during the ignition process 
				and residue is quickly blown from the combustion chamber upon ignition of 
				the liquid fuel.</li>

				<li>Always inspect the engine and other components for damage, apparent 
				overheating or hot spots prior to another firing.</li>

				<li>Some engine designs may exhibit combustion instability (chugging, 
				chuffing, erratic combustion, etc.) at low chamber pressures or low fuel 
				injection velocities. To avoid this problem, the operator should rapidly 
				increase the chamber pressure after initial introduction of the 
				liquid fuel.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Ignition and operation of small liquid-fuel rocket engines in the
			manner described offers the amateur a relatively safe and interesting
			activity. The operator will quickly discover and use many procedures
			to improve engine and test stand operation.</p>

			<p>After achieving initial operation of the engine and test stand,
			the amateur can begin to consider methods of measuring engine thrust,
			determining the heat transfer to the cooling water, and noting the
			characteristics of the rocket engine exhaust. Photography of this
			exhaust is a definite challenge. As these additional features are
			added to the experimertal set-up, the amateur should always keep
			safety and safe operating procedures foremost in mind.</p>

			<!-- CH 11.0 -->
			<h1 id="the-law">The Law</h1>
			
			<p>There are no known laws prohibiting the design or construction of rocket engines,
			rocket vehicles or accessories, in the United States. However, certain communities
			do have laws prohibiting the operation of rocket motors or engines or the free
			flight of rocket powered vehicles. Prior to actually firing a rocket engine the
			amateur builder should make certain that he is not violating established ordinances.
			If ordinances prohibit local testing, a remote site may be needed.</p>

			<p>The amateur builder should keep in mind that a rocket engine, even a small one,
			is an extremely noisy devlce. If local ordinances permit testing in a populated
			area, the amateur should consider the effect of engine operation on his neighbors
			before the initial firing. The noise of a rocket engine comes from the shearing
			action between the high velocity exhaust jet and the surrounding atmospere. Some of
			the noise can be eliminated by firing the engine into a water-cooled duct. Ample
			quantities of water must be sprayed into the exhaust duct to rapidly cool the rocket
			exhaust stream and to protect the duct itself. However, this technique restricts
			viewing of the rocket exhaust plume and eliminates one of the unique features of
			rocket engine operation.</p>

				<li>The Atlas is no longer a "missile" but has been converted into a "space
				launch vehicle".</li>
				
				<li>The calculation in the <a href="#propellant-choice">Propellant Choice</a>
				section assumes that there are no losses; i.e., that the "maximum theoretical"
				I<sub>sp</sub> will be that which is achieved. There are numerous loss terms not
				accounted for; hence the flowrate given is incorrect.</li>
				
				<li>Modern launch vehicles operate fuel rich as stated; however it is not due to a
				desire to reduce the combustion temperature. Rather, the kinetic losses
				(losses due to departure from full shifting equilibrium) are a maximum at
				stoichiometric; the prudent designer therefore selects a mixture ratio "off
				stoichiometric" in order to minimize the kinetic losses.</li>
				
				<li>The <a href="#safety">Safety</a> section, asserts that electrical
				instrumentation wherein a transducer is located on the test stand and an
				electrical readout is located on the operator's station is too expensive for
				most amateurs. This is no longer the case. Actuated valves, pressure
				transducers, etc. and analog-to-digital capture systems for personal computers
				are very reasonable in price. Furthermore, a computer based system can provide
				a complete sensor log for the entire run, that will be extremely valuable in
				diagnosing failure and evaluating performance.</li>
				
				<li>In the <a href="#example">example calculation</a>, I think there may be
				arithmetic errors in the calculation of the coolant flow gap. Readers are
				strongly encouraged to redo all calculations for themselves.</li>

				<li>
					<p><strong>According to John F. Cox [sac10361@saclink.csus.edu]:</strong></p>
					<p>There is a small technical error in the <a href="#heat-transfer">Heat Transfer</a>
					section of the amateur rocket designer's text. At the end of this section
					the author advises that:</p>

						<blockquote>"Material failure is usually caused by either raising the wall
						temperature on the gas side so as to weaken, melt, or damage the wall
						material or by raising the wall temperature on the liquid coolant side
						so as to vaporize the liquid next to the wall. The consequent failure is
						caused because of the sharp temperature rise in the wall caused by
						excessive heat transfer to the boiling coolant."</blockquote>

						<p>Boiling is usually a good thing from the standpoint of heat
						transfer. The author has it right that boiling usually increases the
						heat transfer. Increased heat transfer, however, results in lowered
						temperature. Think about that for a minute and it will become
						obvious.</p>

						<p>The problem with boiling in this application results from something
						that is called alternately film boiling, jacket boiling, or <i>Liedenfrost</i>
						boiling. The boiling rate becomes so intense that a layer of vapor is
						established between the hot wall and the cool liquid. The heat transfer
						properties of boiling liquid are really wonderful. The heat transfer
						properties of gaseous vapor really suck. Once the vapor barrier is
						established, whatever it is that is being cooled will likely melt.</p>

				<p>This book has been out of print and very hard to find for many years. For this
				reason, I decided to undertake the task of putting it into electronic media for
				wider dissemination. If you need to contact me about this book, please email me,
				Daniel Risacher, <u>magnus@alum.mit.edu</u>. However, I wish to reiterate that I am not the
				author of this book, nor am I an expert on rockets. This book was written by Leroy
				Krzycki, who, when I contacted him in 1995, had been retired for some time.</p>

				<p>The book was scanned from a copy provided to me by the generosity and foresight
				of Wayne Gramlich of Sun. Numerous errors were introduced by the scanning and OCR
				process that I and other volunteers removed by hand. Special thanks goes to Jim
				Glass of Rocketdyne for his outstanding efforts.</p>

			<p><strong>Miika Sikala (2nd www edition):</strong></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>In 2018, 22 years after the first WWW edition, I decided to contribute and
				rewrite the whole book. It all started when I was studying for my personal
				project but reading the plain html-version was a bit tough job, especially with
				mobile device. So I started rewriting this with new styles. Of course, it
				eventually resulted a full overhaul including re-rendering all equations and
				redrawing the figures. I also checked equations and figures for errors and fixed
				them. And yeah, fixed <i>quite</i> many typos.</p>

				<p>I'm very grateful to Mr. Krzycki and Mr. Risacher for everything they have
				done to help future rocket engineers.</p>
